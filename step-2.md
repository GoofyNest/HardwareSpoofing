# 🧬 SMBIOS Spoofing Guide (Unfinished)
Work in progress

- Make sure to DUMP your factory looking serials, so you have a backup of your factory settings.
- You’ll need the [binaries](https://github.com/GoofyNest/HardwareSpoofing/releases/tag/release) listed in the referenced repo (⚠️ I did not create these binaries)
- After spoofing all SMBIOS fields, you must reinstall your Operating System
- Reinstall using a clean Windows ISO bootable USB
- Delete all partitions or destroy the RAID pool before reinstalling

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not run AMIDEWIN or DMIEDIT while an anti-cheat system is active.
>
> These tools load a kernel-mode driver to access and modify firmware-level data.
>
> Running them while anti-cheat is open can trigger detections, crashes, or even result in a permanent ban from certain games.

> [!WARNING]
> You might get away skipping some steps — but don’t blame me if you get banned.
> 
> Follow everything carefully for a fully clean slate.
