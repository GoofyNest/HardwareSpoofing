# üñ•Ô∏è Supported Operating System

### ‚úÖ **[Windows 10](https://drive.massgrave.dev/en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f.iso)** ‚Äì Fully supported and recommended

> [!WARNING]
> **Custom Resolution Utility (CRU)** does **not** work reliably on Windows 11.  
> If you're using Windows 11, spoofing your monitor may not be possible.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you like Windows 11 and want to check if your existing monitor does not have a serial number you can run this command in **powershell:**
```
Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\wmi -Class WmiMonitorID | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.UserFriendlyName) {
        $name = ($_.UserFriendlyName | ForEach-Object { [char]$_ }) -join ''
        $serial = ($_.SerialNumberID | ForEach-Object { [char]$_ }) -join ''
        Write-Output "Monitor: $name"
        Write-Output "Serial Number: $serial"
        Write-Output ""
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> You can ignore this limitation **if your monitor does not have a serial number**, or if you're using one of the listed devices we recommend.
> 
> üìù We're working on a document listing **monitors and peripherals that don't include serial numbers**, so you can buy spoof-safe hardware without guessing.

# Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
> [!CAUTION]
> You **must disable the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** in your BIOS.  
> TPM keys are **unique per system** and can be used by anti-cheat systems to instantly identify and ban you.  
> Leaving TPM enabled is one of the fastest ways to get flagged, even if everything else is spoofed.
>
> You can check if TPM is enabled by opening powershell and running this query:

```
get-tpm
```

This should be the console output if disabled:
```
PS C:\Windows\system32> get-tpm


TpmPresent                : False
TpmReady                  : False
TpmEnabled                : False

# Ram modules without (Serial number)
> [!CAUTION]
> You must have Ram that does not have a unique serial number.

**Open cmd.exe** and write this command
```
wmic memorychip get SerialNumber
```

if it reports `00000000` or something that does not look unique, you are good to continue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend using Corsair Vengeance, all their modules (DDR4 and DDR5) does not have a serial number 

> [!TIP]

# üéÆ Graphic card (GPU) spoofing

EasyAntiCheat does not log your graphics card‚Äôs serial number since GPUs are frequently resold, tracking serials would cause many false bans. 
However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that the anticheat does log the name/model of your graphics card.

# üîå USB Adapter spoofing

If you're concerned about USB device serials such as:

- Headset
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- RGB devices (CPU fans, etc.)

You can choose to buy Chinese or unbranded USB peripherals, or simply stick with [Razer](https://www.razer.com/)

Most of the Razer products headsets, mice, keyboards come with no serial numbers from the factory, making them ideal for spoofing purposes.

# üì∂ Router / Network Adapter spoofing

EasyAntiCheat/Vanguard can use ARP and nearby device scanning to catch players in games like Fortnite tournaments. 
If you‚Äôre worried about your MAC address leaking through ARP or nearby device detection, I recommend getting a separate router for your cheating setup, isolating it from your normal devices.

Keep in mind, even if your router supports MAC spoofing, it doesn‚Äôt always mean the spoofed MAC is actually reported to your connected devices.

While I haven‚Äôt personally seen this method used against Rust players on EasyAntiCheat, it‚Äôs definitely something to consider if you want to stay legit.

# MAC Spoofing
> [!TIP]
> Anti-cheats often **flag MAC addresses for about a week after a ban**.  
> To avoid being tracked or temporarily blocked, we recommend:
>
> - Replacing your **new USB Ethernet adapter** after each ban
> - **or**  
> - Replacing your **WiFi chip** after each ban
>
> Swapping either one will give you a fresh MAC address and prevent network-based detection.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to **disable your onboard Ethernet (LAN) adapter** in your BIOS.  
> Leaving it enabled can expose your real MAC address even if you're using a new adapter.

# Disable or Unplug WiFi and Bluetooth card
> [!CAUTION]
> You **must disable WiFi and Bluetooth** in your BIOS or physically remove them from your system.  
> These modules contain **unique MAC addresses and device IDs** that can be used to track and ban you.  
> **Leaving them enabled leaks real hardware data**, even if everything else is spoofed.  
>  
> ‚úÖ You can ignore this warning **only if you replace your WiFi chip after every ban**, as this resets the identifiers.


# Disk Serial spoofing
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use Raid 0 if you are using **AMD**

> [!CAUTION]
> **Intel Raid 0** Is not supported, since EasyAntiCheat can get your real Drive Serial numbers
>
> Please use https://captaindma.com/product/privacy-drive-no-hwid-no-serial-number-drive-512g/ if you are using Intel CPU

## üõ†Ô∏è How Do I Know If My Motherboard Supports RAID 0?
‚úÖ Step-by-step:
- Enter your BIOS/UEFI (usually by pressing DEL, F2, or F10 on boot).
- Look for:
 - SATA Configuration
 - Intel Rapid Storage Technology (IRST) -- Intel boards
 - RAIDXpert2 -- AMD boards
- If you see **RAID MODE**, your board most likely supports RAID 0.
- Refer to your motherboard manual or Google your motherboard model + RAID support.
